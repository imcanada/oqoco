# oqoco
instant loading pages using div's and a script to switch between them
[Demo site](https://imcanada.github.io/oqoco/demo/)

# srcql
scroll between oqoco pages (see [demo 2](https://imcanada.github.io/oqoco/demo2/))
to install you must have oqoco as this is just an expansion of oqoco. after dropping in your site folder and pointing to it with a script tag go into your oqoco.min.js file and add "onl();" in the onload function at the bottom.

preminified version not available because you have to change the code so it works for you first then you can use [this javascript minifier](https://javascript-minifier.com/) to minify the code.
